## [reduce_overfitting_CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/objectc/CNN-with-TensorFlow2.0-and-Keras/blob/master/reduce_overfitting_CNN.ipynb) 
start from a simple CNN based on the data from cifar10, and practice 5 methods to reduce the overfitting problem:
1. Earyly Stopping
2. Data Augmentation
3. Batch Normalization
4. Drop out
5. Regularzation
